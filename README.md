# CSCI_1175_IndustryProjects_Project

###This is the repository for the CSCI 1175 project and all of its files including the project itself, the JUnit4 test of the project classes, and the JavaDoc of the project.###

## Synopsis
This project is called HoursAndFinances.java. It allows a user to input up to 15 items in any given section (i.e. income, expenses, and hours calculator). This will take the information given it and will total the numbers up and create a textfile to print out all of the totals. Hours will be printed in HourPlanner.txt and Financials will be printed in FinancialTracker.txt.

## My Motivation Behind this Project
I wanted to build somethings that I would use. As a student enrolled at SUU in 2018-2020, I would have loved to have this information at hand instead of trying to make excell sheets and spending hours or even days figuring all of this stuff out. This Program tries to alliviate that by doing most of the hard work for the user by calculating the totals for them. It would have saved me hours of time if I had access to this prior to coming to Stech.
